      only specified a relative address for the image. Since we have specified a base URL in the head section,
       the browser will look for the image at "https://www.w3schools.com/images/stickman.gif".</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.24h.com">24h</a> - Notice that the link opens in a new window, 
  even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".</p>
